This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is an online mobile store web application where a user can
add mobiles to their cart and place orders. They can also filter the list of mobiles based on price and can also search a particular mobile by name.
Only logged in users are allowed to place orders. Otherwise, they can still add mobiles to their cart and view cart. Once the order is placed, the cart will be cleared for a fresh order.

## User Login Credentials in Application
Username: *user1*
Password: *pass1*

## Pre-requisites
db.json file contains the data that the fake json server sends to the client. This file is also present under the “src” folder of the project.
Run the following command from the project root folder to start the fake server – 

`json-server --watch src/db.json --port 3004`

Obviously, you would first need to install json-server from npm -

`npm install -g json-server`

Make sure to run this server on port 3004 as the URL from which the data is fetched is hard-coded in the application.

Also, make sure you are connected to the Internet while running the application as all the images are being fetched from the internet with the font-awesome icons.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
